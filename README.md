The directory "simulations" contains all the code for performing simulations in the paper "Constructing Brain Subnetworks via a High-Dimensional Multi-Task Learning Model with Group-wise Mixtures".
You might want to read the instructions in the file "Workflow_simulation.txt"


The directory "data_analysis" contains all the code for real data analysis in the paper "Constructing Brain Subnetworks via a High-Dimensional Multi-Task Learning Model with Group-wise Mixtures".
You might want to read the instructions in the file "Workflow_realdata.txt". 


The directory "demo_datasets" contains some synthetic datasets for illustration purposes. You can try the code on these simulated datasets. 
To comply with NIH regulation on protecting sensitive/confidential data or UK Biobank (UKB) policy, we cannot release the real datasets used in simulation or real data analysis.
Therefore, we synthesized the datasets under the directory "demo_datasets" for illustration purpose. 
Before running the R scripts, please store all the downloaded datasets and all the R scripts under the same directory.
